This is the code-behind of my live coding portion in the Rx Beyond Basics talk on 30/07/18 at [Soluto](https://www.solutotlv.com/)
You'll find two branches here - 
[before-talk](https://github.com/AvivRubys/rx-beyond-basics/tree/before-talk) and 
[after-talk](https://github.com/AvivRubys/rx-beyond-basics/tree/after-talk). The latter contains the edits I made during the talk itself, the former does not.

The twitter api keys have been revoked, but you're welcome to generate your own and check it out :)

Just run `yarn` or `npm install` in each folder (`server` and `client`), and run `npm start` in both and everything should connect and start chugging along.

Enjoy :)
